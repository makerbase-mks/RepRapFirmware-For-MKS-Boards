/*
* This version rewritten by gloomyandy to simplify and improve performance.
* The interrupt handler now operates in a more predictable way with the time needed
* being linearly related to the number of active channels. Care has been taken to
* try to minimize the number of interrupts needed by allowing channels that have period
* this is a multiple of other channels to be synchronized. The following timing offers
* a comparison to previous versions. A simple test that involved running a simulation
* of the well known 3DBenchy was run with nozzle and bed heaters enabled. Two cooling
* fans were also active. Three versions are compared. The original implementation (1),
* an "improved" version of this code (2) and the current version provided here (3).
* 
* Version     no of interrupts  no of pulses    min time   max time
* 1           1712539           2363134         13uS       45uS
* 2           1708399           2283163         9uS        24uS
* 3           1079673           2159908         3uS         6uS 
*
* The slightly lower no of pulses required by the different versions is due to the overall
* elapsed time being shorter (approx 19mins, 18mins and 17mins).
* Note: The above tests were run on a system configured with no higher priority interrupts
* active. With more recent versions of RRF the software uart runs at a higher priority in
* this configuration the current code has a min time of 3uS and max time of 24uS.
