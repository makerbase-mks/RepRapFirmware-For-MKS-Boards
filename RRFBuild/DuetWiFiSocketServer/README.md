Fork of the Duet WiFi Socket Server for LPC/RRF and updated ESP SDK/Framework
===========================================

# Duet WiFi Socket Server for LPC1768 versions of RRF
This fork of the Duet WiFi Socket Server is intended for use with the LPC1768 version of RRF.
It supports a smaller number of active connections than the standard server (to match the LPC
RRF port). It is also built using a more recent ESP8266 toolkit and framework.
