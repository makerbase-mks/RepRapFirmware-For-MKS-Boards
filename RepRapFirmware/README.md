# LPC/STM32F4 Port of RepRapFirmware v3

This is aport of [RepRapFirmware](https://github.com/Duet3D/RepRapFirmware) for LPC1768/LPC1769 and STM32F4 based boards.  

# What is it?
It is a port of the [RepRapFirmware](https://github.com/Duet3D/RepRapFirmware) version 3 (RRF3) used on the Duet family of controllers.  
The firmware can be used to control 3D printers, CNC machines, laser cutters and more.  
There are a couple of features which sets it aside from Marlin, Smoothieware etc
  - All settings for the firmware are configurable dynamically. No recompiling required
  - Although it supports USB control through software such as Pronterface or Octoprint, the Duet Web Control (DWC) is the best way to control and configure the software
  - Native network control through Wifi, Ethernet or an SBC

The boards which are currently supported are detailed in the wiki [here](https://github.com/gloomyandy/RepRapFirmware/wiki)
