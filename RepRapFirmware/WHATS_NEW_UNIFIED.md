Summary of LPC specific changes
===============================================

Please note
============
The sample board.txt files which are here: https://github.com/gloomyandy/RepRapFirmware/tree/v3.01-dev-lpc/LPC/ExampleBoardConfig are out of date and may contain invalid settings. In addition the current software is not very good at detecting errors in these files and providing feedback to the user. Hopefully this will be improved soon, but for now the best way to check if the settings are correct is to issue an M122 p200 and check that the configuration matches your board. The current best source for the available settings is the configuration source: https://github.com/gloomyandy/RepRapFirmware/blob/v3.01-dev-lpc/src/LPC/BoardConfig.cpp#L33

Version 3.1.1-14
=============
This version contains only two changes...
* Fix for a bug that can result in changes to the PWM output used for Fans/Heaters not being made if the frequency of the output is changed at the same time. Often this willoccur the first time that the speed is set.
* The Ethernet build no longer has support for LCD displays enabled due to memory limitations.

Version 3.1.1-12
=============
This version contains a number of fixes and minor improvements following user testing.
* Detect ADC problems and attempt to fix them. In some situations the ADC does not seem to start operation correctly after reboot. This results in very high (2000 degrees plus) temperature readings. This change attempts to detect this and restart the ADC.
* UART 3 support is now enabled by default. This allows the WiFi UART interface and PanelDue to be used at the same time on some hardware (BTT SKR V1.4).
* Fix firmware reset caused by division by zero when setting the PWM frequency to zero.
* Added Azteeg X5 mini v2 and MKS SGen L (thanks to Jay_S).

Version 3.1.1-9
=============
This version contains changes to allow the updating of ESP8266 WiFi firmware via the serial port interface. Note that to use this change may require hardware changes to any adaptor boards you are using. Also includes updates to the USB serial port implementation to reduce memory and improve performance.


Version 3.1.1-8
=============
This version contains one major new feature, support for TMC2209 devices which includes stall detection and sensorless homing. However it also includes a number of other changes (some to support the TMC2209 feature, others to fix bugs or improve other features), these are detailed below:
* New board.txt setting stepper.TmcDiagPins = {<pin 0>, <pin 2>, ...} This setting is used to provide details of the pins used for the TMC2209 DIAG output. This must be provided for the drivers which use stall detection/sensorless homing. By Default no pins are defined.
* SerialUSB Writeable now returns the number of bytes that can be written. This will hopefully fix some of the watchdog timeouts caused by the firmware attempting to write data when no program was consuming the output. There may still be problems with debug output.
* New software PWM implementation. This new implementation has a lower overhead then the original version and is more robust to situations in which the timer is set to times that have already passed. 
* Fix watchdog timeout caused by PanelDue or other serial devices. This was caused by by the PanelDue output generating framing errors that were not cleared when enabling the UART.
* DMA completion interrupts. These have been reworked to allow devices to use completion interrupts that are called at a different interrupt level to that used by the main DMA device. This in turn allows us to use a higher priority interrupt for the DMA devices itself while still allowing the use of DMA with devices that make use of RTOS scheduling.
* Various build system changes. The new TMC2209 driver is now located in the LPC specific part of the tree, the build scripts have been updated for this and to preserve the map files for debug use.
* Flash accelerator configuration. Previous builds used settings that are in theory invalid for the LPC1769 chip.
* Zero allocated memory. Allocated memory was previously left uninitialised, this could cause unpredictable results in some situations.
* Adjusted interrupt priorities. This allows the TMC2209 driver to run the serial communications (via the software UART) at a higher baud rate, which allows changes to stall detection, motor current etc. to propagate to the drivers more rapidly.
* Increased GCode buffer size from 101 to 201 bytes to match Duet settings.
* Various debug enhancements, allow better stack capture/display, pwm debug display, USBSerial display.

Version 3.1.1
=============
* Updated to include bugfixes from DC42
* Fixed problem with default MAC address for Ethernet builds that resulted in some routers not providing an IP address.
* Added board configuration for Azteeg X5 Mini V3 (Thanks to Jay_s)

Version 3.1.0
============
Updated to the 3.1.0 release of RRF from DC42


Version 3.01 RC12+
=============
* New features
    * Added configuration option stepper.numSmartDrivers = <n> to allow the number of smart drivers (TMC22XX) to be limited. The drivers must be contiguous and start at unit 0. So if you have a BTT SKR V1.4 board with say 3 TMC2208s and 1 other driver, the 2208s must be in slots 0, 1, 2 and the remainiong driver in slot 3 or 4. You can use RRF to assign any of those slots to an axis/extruder.
    * Added configuration option SSP0.pins = {SCK, MISO, MOSI, CS} to allow using the alternate hardware pins on port 1 to be used for the SSP0 pins SCK can be 0.15/1.20, MISO 0.17/1.23, MOSI 0.18/1.24 and CS 0.16/1.21. This options allows a modified SBase board to be used with a standard WiFi firmware build.
* Known issues
    * Running with just a single TMC22XX driver will result in a large number of read timeouts.


Version 3.01 RC12
=============
* Updated to RC12 from DC42
* Added capability to update the LPC firmware via DWC when operating in SBC mode

Version 3.01 RC6
==============
* Updated with latest RC6 from DC42. 
* Various SBC communication parameters adjusted to bring them into line with the Duet.
* Network task stack size increased to avoid stack overflow resets

Version 3.01 RC5
==============
* Updated with latest RC5 from DC42. 


Version 3.01 RC4
==============
* Added initial experimental support for SBC interface

* Added configurable UART class to allow selecting UART from board config by using the RX/TX pins for AUX serial and WIFI Serial.
    * AUX serial pins will default to the UART0 pins as it has done in previous versions. Setting Aux serial to NoPin, NoPin can save a bit of memory as the buffers won't be created.
    * New board.txt entries:
        * 8266wifi.serialRxTxPins - array of pins {RX, TX} (Requires WIFI to be compiled into binary)
        * serial.aux.rxTxPins - array of pins {RX, TX}
        * serial.aux2.rxTxPins - array of pins {RX, TX}  (Requires AUX2 to be compiled into binary)

* Added board.txt entry "heat.spiTempSensorChannel" to select the spi channel for the SPI Temperature sensors. Defaults to SSP0.

Version 3.01 RC3
================
* Added new build option TMC22XX set to true to provide support for TMC22XX drivers via the UART interface.
* Added new build option ESP8266WIFI_SERIAL (available when usinf ESP8266 WiFi) define this to use enable the UART interface to the ESP8266 board. Note that on SKR based boards only a single UART device is easily available and so to allow the use of panel due and other serial based control screens this option should not be enabled.
* New pin names. The pin names used for the various boards has been updated to provided a consistant naming policy across different boards.


Version 3.01 Beta2
=================

* Removed board.txt entry: stepper.hasDriverCurrentControl. Now relies on stepper.digipotFactor being set to enable current control.

Version 3.01 beta1
=================

* Added new board.txt entry "lpc.adcEnablePreFilter" to enable/disable the ADC prefilter. [Experimental]


Version 3.0 beta13
=================

* Implemented DMA. SharedSPI updated to use DMA for SSP and also blocks while waiting to complete (or timeout) so RTOS can process other tasks while watiting
* Removed lpc.uartPanelDueMode as M575 supports new raw mode from 3.0b13.
* Added new board.txt entries for ESP8266Wifi:
    * 8266wifi.EspDataReadyPin - this pin needs to be on Port 0 or Port 2 as it uses external interrupts
    * 8266wifi.LpcTfrReadyPin
    * 8266wifi.EspResetPin



Version 3.0 beta3
=================


### Board Config (board.txt)

* Removed Fan Pins, Heater Pins, Tacho pins and Endstops configuration options as they are now configurable by GCode (See GCode M950) and needs to be set in config.g (See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/RepRapFirmware_3_overview).
* Removed SpecialPins as it's no longer required in RRF3. M950 is now used to create a "gpio port number", and that gpio port number is used in M42 and M280.
* Removed lpc.externalInterruptPins config. It is now done automatially when attempting to attach an interrupt to a pin on port 0 or port 2 (i.e. for Fan Tacho pin or configuring a filament detector).
* Removed lpc.slowPWM.pins, lpc.fastPWM.pins and lpc.servoPins. They are now assigned automatically when using M950.
* PWM for heaters and fans are now generated using a free running timer. This allows creating different PWM with frequencies instead of being limited to 2 options.  
* Added new entry: lpc.board. Currently supported values are: smoothieboard, rearm,  mkssbase_1.3, azsmzmini, biquskr_1.1, biquskr_1.3, azteegx5mini_1.1 and generic.  For example: lpc.board = smoothieboard;
    * Currently does not support control of drivers via UART/SPI on Biqu SKR 1.3. 
    * When defining a board, the names on the silk screen (or official pinout if there is no names on the silk) can be used in M950. LPC style of port.pin (i.e. 1.23) can also be used if desired, however.
    * For ReArm, the silk on the RAMPs shield is used and additionally support from the official pinout that uses arduino mega naming can be used, i.e. D8, etc.
    * For the above boards (except generic), some defaults are included in the firmware for stepper pins (en/step/dir), current control and will be used as the default. They can be overriden by defining those variables in board.txt.
    * The generic board has no defaults. 
* Added new atxPowerPinInverted entry which is set to true or false.  Set to true if the PSON needs to be inverted. Default is False.
* Added new lpc.externalSDCard.spiChannel to select which hardware SSP pins are used for SDCard. Must be 0 to select SSP0 or 1 to select SSP1. Default is SSP1.


Version 2.04RC1
=================

### Board Config (Board.txt)
* Software SPI added. New pin arrary option:  lpc.softwareSPI.pins
    * Assigns GPIO pins to operate as SoftwareSPI.
    * Default Value: lpc.softwareSPI.pins = {NoPin, NoPin, NoPin} ; //Set to GPIO pins to use as SCK, MISO, MOSI
* New SPI Channel options added for ExternalSDCard and LCD. Channel 0 = SSP0, 1 = SSP1 and 2 = SoftwareSPI
    * lpc.externalSDCard.spiChannel option added to select SPI Channel external SDCard uses.
    * lcd.spiChannel option added to select SPI Channel LCD uses (typically 0 or 2). Default



Version 2.03
=================

### SDCard

* Updated functions for SDCard and SharedSPI to improve performance now using ChaN 2018 routines. Includes 16bit block transfers and takes advantage of the LPC SSP 8 frame FIFOs. 
* Added detection for SDCards that support HighSpeed mode which enables the card interface SPI speeds up to 50MHz.
* Added check to ensure that if user enters a higher SPI frequency than the card can support to only use the max card speed.
* If users select a slower SPI speed than the card can handle, that speed will instead be used (i.e. to have slower SPI speeds over long cables for external SDCard slot if desired).
* Implemented SDCard read/write retries as RRF does.

### Networking

* Fixed a bug causing a buffer to not be freed after a read socket error.
* Added mutexes to the callbacks which are called from a different task (IPTask).
* Upgraded FreeRTOS+TCP to V2.0.11
* Added extra FreeRTOS priorty and changed priories so the EMac task has a higher priority than IPTask.   
* Removed the f_expand to preallocate space as it takes longer than the default network time out when uploading large files.
